            <h3>The Fox and The Hare</h3>
            <P>A hare was staring at a fox in admiration. </P>
            <p>The fox asked, "What are you staring at?" </p>
            <p>The hare said in an anxious voice, â€œI was wondering about you". </p>
            <p>The fox asked, "What is the wonder with me?" 
            </p>
            <p>The hare said "Are you really as cunning as people say?" 
            </p>
            <p>The fox looked at the hare with a thoughtful look and replied after some silent moments, "Well! Why don't you do one thing? Come tonight and join me for dinner. We shall discuss the matter". 
            </p>
            <p> The hare went to the fox's house at night. On the dining table were laid plates and bowls. But there was no food at all. The hare thought, "Oh! What a fool I am! The fox has planned to eat me" and he ran away. </p>
            <p>MORAL : Cunning words are undependable </p>
